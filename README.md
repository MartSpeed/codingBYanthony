My name is John Anthony. I enjoy working as a Fullstack Software Developer & Aircraft Maintenance Technician. I served in the military for 8 years as an aircraft recovery maintenance technician. TO be it into other terms, I troubleshoot the causes of what breaks or crashes an aircraft, recovered the working & non-working aircraft, diagnose the issue and then repair the aircraft if need be or start on a new one if it is not deemed worthy. I find programming to be very similar, with the caveat being that you build it, then you diagnose what broke along the way. Programming shares a lot of traits with aircraft maintenance inspections, part repairs (removal and/or replacement), updates, inspections, quality assurance and more. They require the same critical thinking, team work and mental effort to ensure the job is done. That is why is enjoy it just as much. The key difference between both fields being logical versus physical problems have very different approaches in how you fix them, but they are start the same with the why you fix them. Something has broken and needs to be repaired.
