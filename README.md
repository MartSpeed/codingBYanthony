My name is John Anthony. I enjoy working as a Fullstack Software Developer & Aircraft Maintenance Technician. I served in the United States Air Force for eight years as an aircraft recovery maintenance technician. To put it into other terms, I performed fault isolation (troubleshooting) step to find the causes of what breaks and/or crashes an aircraft. My duties including recovering the working or non-working aircraft, diagnose the issue and then repair the aircraft if maintenance work was required or start on a new job request if it is not deemed worthy. I find programming to be very similar, with the caveat being that you build an intangible product, then you diagnose what broke along the way. Programming shares a lot of traits with aircraft maintenance inspections, part repairs (removal and/or replacement), updates, and quality assurance. They require the same critical thinking, team work skills and mental effort to ensure the job is done and completed correctly. That is why I enjoy programming just as much! The key difference between both fields being logical versus physical problems have very different approaches in how you fix them, but they start the same with why you fix them. Something has broken and needs to be repaired.
